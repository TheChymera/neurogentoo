	Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) refers to the construction and assessment
	of spatially extended statistical processes used to test hypotheses about
	functional brain imaging data. These ideas have been instantiated in software
	that is called SPM. It is designed for the analysis of fMRI, PET, SPECT, EEG
	and MEG data. The package can work with either Octave (free) or Matlab (non-free).
